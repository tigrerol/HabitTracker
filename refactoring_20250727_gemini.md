# Refactoring Suggestions for HabitTracker - 2025-07-27

This document outlines the findings and suggestions from a code review of the HabitTracker project.

## High-Level Architecture

*   **Swift Package for Feature:** The use of a Swift Package (`HabitTrackerFeature`) to encapsulate the core feature logic is excellent. This promotes modularity, reusability, and separation of concerns.
*   **MVVM-like Pattern:** The code seems to follow a Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) like pattern, with `Observable` classes acting as view models (e.g., `RoutineService`, `SmartRoutineSelector`). This is a good choice for SwiftUI apps.
*   **Service-Oriented Architecture:** The use of services (e.g., `RoutineService`, `LocationService`, `PersistenceService`) is a good practice for separating concerns and making the code more testable.

## Code Quality & Maintainability

*   **Clear Naming:** The naming of files, classes, and methods is generally clear and descriptive.
*   **Use of Protocols:** The use of protocols (e.g., `PersistenceServiceProtocol`, `HabitInteractionHandler`) is a great way to define contracts and enable dependency injection, which improves testability.
*   **Constants:** The `AppConstants` enum is a good way to centralize constants and avoid magic numbers.
*   **Error Handling:** The `ErrorHandlingService` and custom error types (`HabitTrackerError`, `LocationError`, etc.) provide a robust way to handle and report errors.
*   **Accessibility:** The `AccessibilityConfiguration` enum and related view extensions show a strong commitment to accessibility.

## Areas for Improvement & Suggestions

### 1. Persistence Layer

*   **Mixture of UserDefaults and SwiftData:** The persistence layer currently uses a mix of `UserDefaults` and `SwiftData`. While the `SwiftDataPersistenceService` is a good step towards a more robust solution, some settings are still stored in `UserDefaults`.
*   **Suggestion:** Consolidate all persistence into `SwiftData` for a unified and more powerful data layer. This will also make it easier to implement features like CloudKit sync in the future. The `DataModelConfiguration` already provides a good foundation for this.

### 2. Location Service

*   **Complexity:** The `LocationService` is quite complex, handling both location updates and geofencing.
*   **Suggestion:** Consider splitting the `LocationService` into two separate services: one for getting the current location (`LocationProvider`) and another for managing geofencing and location-based logic (`GeofencingService`). This would improve separation of concerns.

### 3. View Logic

*   **Large Views:** Some views, like `RoutineBuilderView`, are quite large and contain a lot of logic.
*   **Suggestion:** Break down large views into smaller, more manageable subviews. For example, the different steps in the `RoutineBuilderView` could be extracted into their own views.

### 4. Conditional Habit Logic

*   **Complex Handling:** The logic for handling conditional habits in `RoutineService` and `RoutineBuilderView` is quite complex.
*   **Suggestion:** Create a dedicated `ConditionalHabitService` to encapsulate the logic for handling conditional habit responses and modifying the routine queue. This would simplify the `RoutineService` and make the conditional habit logic more reusable.

### 5. Testing

*   **Good Test Coverage:** The project has a good amount of unit tests, which is excellent.
*   **Suggestion:** Continue to expand the test coverage, especially for the more complex logic in the services and view models. Consider adding more UI tests to ensure the user interface behaves as expected.

## Refactoring Plan

Based on these findings, here is a suggested refactoring plan:

1.  **Consolidate Persistence:**
    *   [ ] Migrate all `UserDefaults` persistence to `SwiftData`.
    *   [ ] Update the `PersistenceServiceProtocol` to be fully `SwiftData`-based.
    *   [ ] Remove the `UserDefaultsPersistenceService`.

2.  **Refactor Location Service:**
    *   [ ] Create a `LocationProvider` service responsible for getting the current location.
    *   [ ] Create a `GeofencingService` responsible for managing geofencing and location-based logic.
    *   [ ] Update the `SmartRoutineSelector` to use the new location services.

3.  **Refactor Views:**
    *   [ ] Break down `RoutineBuilderView` into smaller subviews for each step.
    *   [ ] Extract the logic for each habit type in `HabitInteractionView` into its own view, and use a `ViewBuilder` to construct the appropriate view.

4.  **Create Conditional Habit Service:**
    *   [ ] Create a `ConditionalHabitService` to handle conditional habit logic.
    *   [ ] Move the conditional habit handling logic from `RoutineService` and `RoutineBuilderView` to the new service.

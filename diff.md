# Comparison: Requirements vs. Current Implementation (Inferred from File Structure)

This document outlines the observed differences between the `Requirements.md` document and the current project implementation, based solely on the provided file and directory structure. Direct code inspection was not performed.

## 1. Core Features Overview

### 1.1. Session-Based Architecture

*   **Requirements**: Morning Routine, Daily Planning, Evening Routine, Weekly Planning Sessions.
*   **Inferred Implementation**:
    *   `HabitTrackerWatch Watch App/Views/RoutineExecutionView.swift` and `RoutineListView.swift` suggest that some form of routine management and execution is present, at least for the Watch app.
    *   It's unclear from the file structure whether all four specific session types (Morning, Daily Planning, Evening, Weekly Planning) are fully implemented or if the main iOS app has its own routine management.

### 1.2. Habit Types & Interaction Models

*   **Requirements**:
    *   **Physical Habits**: Checkbox, Timer-Based, Rest Timer.
    *   **Integrated Habits**: App Launch, Website Habits.
    *   **Quantifiable Habits**: Counter Habits.
*   **Inferred Implementation**:
    *   `HabitTrackerWatch Watch App/Views/TimerView.swift` strongly indicates that **Timer-Based Habits** are implemented, at least on the Watch.
    *   `HabitTrackerWatch Watch App/Models/WatchModels.swift` likely contains the data structures for `Habit` and `HabitType`, which would define the various habit types. However, direct confirmation of Checkbox, Rest Timer, App Launch, Website, and Counter habits being fully implemented is not possible from file names alone.

## 2. Detailed User Experience Flow

*   **Requirements**: Detailed UI flows for Morning, Daily Planning, Throughout the Day, and Evening routines, including specific screen layouts and interactions.
*   **Inferred Implementation**:
    *   The presence of `RoutineExecutionView.swift` and `RoutineListView.swift` suggests that some guided execution and routine display exists.
    *   However, the specific UI layouts, detailed interaction models (e.g., auto-advance, skip/postpone), and features like "Smart Scheduling" or "Contextual Reminders" (e.g., location-based, energy level consideration) cannot be confirmed or denied solely from the file structure.

---

## 3. Smart Scheduling & Reminders

*   **Requirements**: Adaptive Timing, Context Awareness (Location, Calendar, Weather), Reminder Types (Push, Widget, Apple Watch, Live Activities), Scheduling Strategies (Time Blocking, Flexible Scheduling).
*   **Inferred Implementation**:
    *   The file structure does not provide direct evidence of these advanced scheduling and reminder features. While `UserNotifications` or `CoreLocation` might be used internally, their specific implementation for "Adaptive Timing" or "Context Awareness" is not visible.
    *   `WatchConnectivityManager.swift` confirms communication with the Watch, which is relevant for Apple Watch reminders.
    *   `WidgetKit` and `ActivityKit` usage for widgets and Live Activities cannot be confirmed from the file names.

---

## 4. Data Model Structure

*   **Requirements**: `Habit`, `HabitType`, `Frequency`, `RoutineSession`, `HabitCompletion` structs/enums.
*   **Inferred Implementation**:
    *   `HabitTrackerWatch Watch App/Models/WatchModels.swift` is highly likely to contain the definitions for `Habit` and related data models for the Watch app. It's reasonable to assume similar models exist for the main iOS app, possibly within `HabitTrackerPackage/Sources/HabitTrackerFeature/`.
    *   The exact fields and relationships as defined in `Requirements.md` (e.g., `targetValue`, `restDuration`, `mood`) cannot be verified without inspecting the code.

---

## 5. Technical Considerations

*   **Requirements**:
    *   Minimum iOS Version: iOS 18.0
    *   Key Frameworks: SwiftUI, Swift Concurrency, WidgetKit, SwiftData, UserNotifications, CoreLocation, HealthKit, EventKit, BackgroundTasks, ActivityKit.
    *   Architecture Pattern: MV (Model-View) with SwiftUI, @Observable, Actor-based concurrency.
    *   Background Capabilities, Privacy & Security.
*   **Inferred Implementation**:
    *   **SwiftUI**: Confirmed by `.swift` files and `HabitTrackerApp.swift`.
    *   **Swift Concurrency**: Likely used given modern Swift development, but not explicitly visible.
    *   **SwiftData**: Not explicitly visible in file names.
    *   **WatchOS App**: Confirmed by `HabitTrackerWatch Watch App/`.
    *   **Offline Capabilities**: `OfflineQueueManager.swift` suggests this.
    *   **Watch Connectivity**: `WatchConnectivityManager.swift` confirms this.
    *   Other frameworks like `WidgetKit`, `UserNotifications`, `CoreLocation`, `HealthKit`, `EventKit`, `BackgroundTasks`, `ActivityKit` are not explicitly visible in the file structure, though they might be used within the code.
    *   The specific architecture pattern (MV, @Observable, Actor-based concurrency) cannot be confirmed without code inspection.

## 6. Advanced Features (Future Considerations)

*   **Requirements**: Social Features, AI Integration, Health Integration, Gamification.
*   **Inferred Implementation**: As per the `Requirements.md` document, these are explicitly listed as "Future Considerations" and are not expected to be part of the current implementation. The file structure does not show any evidence of these features.

---

## 7. Monetization Strategy

*   **Requirements**: Freemium Model with Free and Premium Tiers, specific pricing.
*   **Inferred Implementation**: The file structure does not contain any explicit files or directories related to in-app purchases, subscriptions, or monetization logic. This suggests the monetization strategy is not yet implemented.

---

## Conclusion

The project structure indicates a strong foundation for a habit tracking application, particularly with the presence of a dedicated Watch app and modular design using a Swift Package. Core UI elements for routine management and timers are suggested.

However, many of the advanced features detailed in the `Requirements.md`, such as sophisticated smart scheduling, deep contextual awareness, integration with HealthKit/EventKit, and the full range of habit types (beyond timers), are not directly verifiable from the file structure alone. Similarly, the monetization strategy is not evident.

Further code inspection would be required to determine the exact extent of implementation for features not clearly indicated by file names.
